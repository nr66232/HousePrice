# Project Name
> Regression model using regularisation for house price prediction



<!-- You can include any other section that is pertinent to your problem -->

## General Information

A US-based housing company plans to enter the Australian market. The company purchases houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.
They use data analytics to support this business model.

The company has now collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. 

We need to build a regression model for this company using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties. Company will use this model to decide whether it will be profitable to invest in them or not.

 
The company wants to know following:

1. Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house?

2. How well those variables describe the price of a house?
